# Out-Jump

Jump to the top as quickly as possible so that you avoid the rising floor

Try to collect all 3 stars in each level on your way up

You can bounce off the edges of the walls to give you a better advantage

Avoid falling off the side and the bottom floor as you try to get to the top fast!
